A personal blog and website by Tobias Doll.

Born in Karlsruhe in 1985, Tobias holds a M.A. in classical archeology from Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz and a M.Sc. in cultural heritage preservation from Technische Universität Berlin. He has worked on different excavations and projects in Germany, Greece, Italy and Norway.

After university he drifted into IT-jobs, working mostly in the fields of quality management and software testing. He is an avid user of software for automated testing, like Selenium and the cucumber framework for Ruby. His jobs contain working with difficult data structures in different formats.

He is interested in everything that combines the wonders of cultural heritage and the possibilities of information technology.

He is currently living in Berlin and hopes to find more time for blogging.

This site is powered by github-pages, running a modified version of the [mediator theme](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
